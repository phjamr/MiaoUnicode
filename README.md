# MiaoUnicode

"Miao Unicode" is a Graphite enabled font for the Miao (Pollard) script used by several language communities in southern China.

The script was added to Unicode in January 2012 with version 6.1.0. "Miao Unicode" appears to be the first font to be publicly released which covers this Unicode block.

Adobe's open source font ["Source Sans Pro"][ssp] provides the Latin script counterpart for the font and the base for the Miao design.

Since the Miao script involves complex rendering (such as vowel marks being raised/lowered according to the tone) the font will only behave correctly in applications which provide Graphite support. These include Mozilla Firefox (11+), LibreOffice (3.4+), OpenOffice (3.2+), Xetex (0.997+). In most Linux distributions the pango-graphite package can enable Graphite support for applications like Inkscape and gedit as well. For more information see http://graphite.sil.org/.
